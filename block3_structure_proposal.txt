- Sub-block: Merge reverse/forward reads
	- Read .csv linkage table
	- Filter table to find ChIP-seq files that need merging
	- Sort files by genome, then by biosource then by chromosome (if split by chromosome)
	- Note:
	  - Files will already have correct names and endings
	  - chromosome will be last part of file name before file ending
	  - First part of file name will be Project ID (needed to groop files)
	  - "forward" or "reverse" will be part of file name
	  - So far it looks like merging will only be neccessary for ChIP-seq files
	- Group files in pairs to be merged
	- Check file endings:
	  - If not bigwig file format, convert to bigwig using tool
	- Use tool to merge files
	- Convert files back to old format using tool
	- Delete old files after merging
	- Delete entries for old files from linkage table
	- Update linkage table for new merged files
	

- Sub-block: Prep for normalizing
	- Notes:
	  - Files to be checked are all sequence techniques and formats including bigwig, bigbed, bed and bedgraph
	- Check bins in all bigwig files
	  - Only in bigwig files or in all files?
	  - Note whether bin sizes match
	  - If they do not match, note bin size per file, not most common bin size
	- Check signal range accross all files
	  - Note whether signal ranges are similar
	  - If not, note signal ranges per file and note most common signal range


- Sub-block: Normalize files
	- For all file types mentioned in previous block
	- Either find tool to adjust bin size to be the same everywhere or do it manually
	- Either find tool to nomralize signal ranges to be the same everywhere or do it manually


- Notes: 
	- SAM/BAM and FastQ files do not need to be normalized
	- Use available tools/packages whenever possible
