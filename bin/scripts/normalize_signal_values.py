"""
Methods for normalizing ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq signal values.

Goes through the following steps:
- Read in linkage table .csv file as data frame
- Log scale all files
- min-max scale all files (to a range of 0-1)

To-do:
- Bin size problem:
    - Narrow and broad peaks -> narrow peaks only has summit? One value for
      multiple pos? Problem that needs solving
- Min-max scaling:
    - Does it make sense to scale each file individually or do I need a
    global min and max?


Use as follows:
